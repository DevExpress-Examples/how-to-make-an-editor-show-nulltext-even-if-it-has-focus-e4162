# How to show NullText in a focused editor

The [NullText](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Editors.BaseEdit.NullText) property allows you to show a custom caption in empty editors. The default behavior is that focused editors hide this caption. To change this behavior in **v19.2** and newer, set the built-in [ShowNullTextIfFocused](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Editors.TextEdit.ShowNullTextIfFocused?v=19.2) property to **true**.
